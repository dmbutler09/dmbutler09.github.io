              For my last trick! I want to make a dice box for my D&D games. I want it to
            have a lid and a partition to hold dice. I found a picture online
          that is close to what I want and started there. Then I created a sketch
        of what I wnt taking into account the measurements of what I need. The box will be
      8x8in with a 2in partition for dice.

            <h1 class="sectionheader"> STEP 2 </h1>
            <p style="float: left; width: 30%">
              The next part was re-creating the sketch in OnShape and making sure the pieces fit
              together online. I had to make a few changes to how I envisioned the
              lid woirking. In my sketch I imagined a 3D printed rod to act as the moving part
              but in OnShape I designed for the rivets that we received earlier this
              quarter. After designing in OnShape I exported the individual pieces
              to DXF files and combined them into a PDF for easy laser cutting. The next
              step is laser cutting which I will be doing tonight.

                Step 3 was my tolerance test before I actually printed out all of my
                pieces, and I'm glad I did it because the tolerances were WAY off.
                Initially the female parts were .51 x .135 in. while the male were
                .125 x .5 in. This made theoretical sense, but not practical. I ended
                up having to go back to OnShape and changing the female parts to
                .465 x .116 in. Also I learned in this step that my usual laser cut
                settings didn't work. When I ran the first tolerance cut the laser did
                not cut all the way through the wood. The new settings I would need
                were:
                <br>
                <br>
                Speed: 10%
                Power: 100%
                Frequency: 100%
                </p>

              <p style="float: left; width: 30%">
                Now to cut the actual pieces. One of the laser cutters in the Mill
                was not working so I had to cut my pieces on two different pieces of
                wood instead one big piece like I planned. No biggie, the Mill staff
                were able to exchange the wood I bought for 2 of the smaller size with
                no problem.

               <p style="float: left; width: 30%">
                 My tolerance test betrayed me. Even though the test plug I printed fit into
                 the smallest sized hole, the actual pieces did not fit at all. I thought
                 I'd have to reprint the bottom and top, BUT i decided to give sanding a try first.
                 AND IT WORKED!!! I folded some sand paper really small and was able to make
                 the holes in the bottom and top just a little bigger.

                <p style="float: left; width: 30%">
                  Now that everything fits it was time to assemble this sucker. Which
                  was pretty easy. Unfortunately, I am only human so my sanding job
                  was imperfect so some of the pieces fit very tightly, others not so
                  tightly, but still a good fit all around. It holds its shape on its
                  own, opens and closes. I realized at this point I glossed over the
                  measurements for the movement. When open the box stopped at about a
                  45ยบ angle and would fall closed if I let it go. A problem that was
                  easily solved by... THE SANDMAN. I sanded the top down and the
                  rotating pieces inside the box until I could open the box all the
                  way and it stays open at 90ยบ.
