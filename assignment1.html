            I began this project by deciding on the shape I wanted for my kit. I
            decided to usual my initals because I couldn't think of a creative shape
            and these were readily available. I didn't really consider the size
            I wanted the shapes to be. I focused on how I wanted them to fit together.
            I used divets that sick out and cut into the 'D' and 'B' shapes.

            The next steps were to test the prints. The first set was about 4x4
            in., but didn't hold together very well. I also didn't want each piece
            to be huge. I wanted something I could easily hold together. I shrunk
            the shapes to about 3x3 in. Then I changed the the parts that stick
            out to be slightly larger that the parts that go in. (.52 in. & .47 in.
            respectively)

             After a few fitting tests it was time for production and to build the
             weird stuff you see below. My laser settings on the left show the speed
             at 25%, while power and frequency were both at 100%. Except for a few
             rare areas the laser always cut all the way through.

             Thanks Hannah for the laser cutting support!
