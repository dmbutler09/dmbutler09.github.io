            My name is D'Marcus Butler. I am a 2nd year master's student in HCDE
             and I'll be finishing in June! (Yass!) Most of my expertise is in
             visual design. I'm taking digital fabrication
             to get hands-on and build some things. The only space I haven't explored
             in the program is the physical.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to learn to build with a few different types of materials and
            methods. I'm also experienced with Illustrator and I have a bit of HTML
            experience, and I am happy to share what I know.
