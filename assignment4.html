            I went for a simpler approach on this project and wanted to create something
            like what is pictured above. As usual I started out with a sketch.
            I planned to use ball joints at first, but after a meeting with Joshua,
            I decided to use the rivets provided in class. I thought it would be easier.
            While doing this sketching and planning phase, I had to measure a lot more pieces
            than I originally thought.

            After sketching, it was time to build the snake in OnShape. OnShape is
            a WAAAYYY easier tool than Rhino. However, I still ran into trouble when
            it came to simple tasks like panning around the screen and altering parts that
            I had already made. Some parts of the shape aren't exactly how I want them
            to look, but the overall shape is right and the rivets should fit in their
            appropriate spaces.

                I set up my .stl file in Dremel and found out it'd take a whopping
                13 hours to print 4 of my pieces. Unfortunately, I did not have time to
                print the project before class. I even tried adjusting the density and
                support settings, but could only change the print time by an hour at most.

              I played around with the assembly in OnShape, but as intuitive as the program is,
              it couldn't conceive of how I'd put these pieces together... or I couldn't figure
              out the correct way to tell it to put them together. My thought is that
              the outcropping pieces will stack on the ends of each piece. The outcropping
              pieces would alternate at the joints, piece A, piece B, piece A2, piece B2.
