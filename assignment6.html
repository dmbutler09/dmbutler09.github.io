            For this assignment I want to make a large 20-sded die for my D&D games.
            So I found this Icosahedron on Thingiverse that I want to cast.
            <br>

            You can view the Thingiverse page for my model <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1648593">here.</a>

            <p style="float: left; width: 30%">
            Next I set up my casting mold in Rhino. I split the mesh model in half
            and aligned the flat sides to the bottom of the casting box (the machineable
            wax). I added a sprue for when I pour in the plaster and some registration
            marks to preserve my alignment.

                The third step of this process was creating toolpaths in Fusion 360
                for milling. I was not able to cut my machineable wax on the CNC
                mill because it was too big. I had to shave off a few inches and
                cut it in half.(Thanks Nadya for helping me cut that down.) This
                also meant I had to redo my file so that it was in two parts instead
                of one. Here is also where I prepped my Bantam files after generating
                g.code in fusion. Also thanks to Joshua for helping me get my g.code
                files set up the second time.

                Time to mill it. The mill kicked up a lot of scraps and I stopped
                to vacuum it a time or two. In Bantam, I noticed my g.code was the wrong size so after going back to fix that
                (multiplying by a factor of 2.54) I also ran into placement issues where
                I did not place my material in an accurate space relating to the
                Bantam model and the mill began to cut over the edge. Instead of
                having to mount my material again, I changed the placement options
                in Bantam and that seemed to solve the problem.

                 Now that I have my milled pieces, it's time to cast my mold. One
                 of the CNC mills in the Mill had a short in the cord and that caused
                 part of my geometry to be offset half way through the process. Also,
                 the one of the mills i used did not add my registration marks.
                 I mixed my Oomoo, and poured some in each mold. In one the solution
                 less even and the silicon was more flexible than the other. Both
                 molds came out very well.

                  Finally time for the plaster. This was the most enjoyable part
                  of the project. I liked the warm feeling of the plaster drying.
                  Even with an imperfect mold and no registration marks the mold held
                  itself together well with the help of a little tape. The first two
                  casts came out perfectly. On the third, I noticed I was starting
                  to run out of plaster and tried to stretch the what I had left.
                  Bad move on my part because my mold began to leak water but I still
                  ended up with 70% of a completed mold. On the last, I imagine I
                  did not dry the mold enough or I still used too much water because
                  leaking was an issue again, but this time some of the actual plaster
                  came out. I had to hold the mold together by hand for a few minutes
                  so that it solidified enouhg to not leak. This last mold still
                  come out very well.

                  special thanks to Lukas for providing the plaster.
