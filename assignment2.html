            This assignment started rather ambitiously. I didn't want to use the
            same objects I used in assignment 1. The sketch here shows 4 distinct
            pieces with most of the object being made of the polygons at the bottom.

            Once the sketching was done, I needed to create the shapes in rhino.
            I quickly saw all of the differences between this and other visual
            design software I had used. I spent most of my time looking for tools
            to do simple tasks like curve corners and mirror shapes. So I simplified
            my idea into just the polygon. Before I could move on to cutting I
            had to do a bit of resizing of my incisions because I forgot to adjust
            my units in Rhino. I did this resizing in Illustrator. When I tried to
            do it in Rhino I broke my original design and had to recreate it.

                Just like in the first assignment I did a few test cuts to see how
                my pieces would fit together and how big they would actually be. I
                also took advantage of being able to test where the laser cutter
                would cut my material by running my job with the lid open. This
                helped me save material and run the cutter fewer times than in the
                first assignment. I used the same laser settings, but noticed a
                few more flames this time than last. In future assignments I may
                change my laser cutting settings.

              The final product worked very well and passes the shake test. The
              notches are a tight fit around the block.
